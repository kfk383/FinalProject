FinalProject - 2D Bowling
=========================
The goal of the project is to create a simple bowling game.

Features that will be utilized:
- A main menu with buttons for game start, instructions, and settings.
- Before launching the ball:
   - Setting the power of launch
   - Setting the position on the alley that the ball will be launched
   - Setting that the ball will be launched from.
- Upon launch:
   - The movement of the ball will be controlled by the computer mouse by some degree to allow for curve balls and a slight change of angle after launch.
   - The view of the GUI will shift so that the striking of the ball with the pins at the end of the alley will be at a bird's eye view.

This project will require:
- The use of JPanel from a regular java program
- The calculation of effective angular movement while the ball is moving (and the implementation of this with the position of the ball in the GUI)
- Knowledge of the rules of bowling
 


January 5, 2015:
- Created a GUI window for the game
- Updated README file with project information

January 6, 2015:
- Added images to GUI
- Researched mouse input/control on JFrame
- Switch project to processing? (if simpler)
- Photoshopped main menu background & logo, but without functions at this point
- Discussed basic functions of the game

January 7, 2015
- Altered code to fit the menu screen background
- Started on mouse commands ( used www.tutorialspoint.com/swing/swing_mouse_listener.htm )
- Added in java documentation for methods already written, excluding mouse commands.
- Discussed how the buttons would work in the main menu (using the mouse location and whether the mouse is clicked)
- Maybe: Change the appearance of the button when the mouse is over it

January 8, 2015
- Used JButton instead of buttons photoshopped into the main menu
- Switched to JPanel for a more flexible interface
- Enhanced GUI and started on actionPerformed method functions

January 9, 2015
-Put buttons onto individual JPanels in order to layer it on top of the background image
-Buttons now appear when scrolled over to the options displayed on the background image
